### This is a comparison/ranking

## My rankings (Best for *our* purposes):

1. **KIA EV9:** (Best performance and space with decent luxury and premium charging capabilities)

2. **Mercedes EQB 350 4MATIC SUV:** (Brand name, luxury, and premium features)

3. **Hyundai IONIQ 9:** (Longest range, wheelbase, and fast-charging)


## Consumer rankings:

1. **Kia EV9:** (Best blend of performance (up to 379 hp), range (up to 304 miles), ultra-fast charging (350 kW), and futuristic design. It also offers a spacious interior, advanced tech like AutoMode (hands-free driving), and a strong value proposition)

2. **Hyundai IONIQ 9:** (Shares the same platform as the EV9 but leans more into luxury and comfort. It offers a longer range (up to 335 miles), massage seats, a quieter ride, and a more refined interior. Slightly less performance-focused than the EV9 but more upscale)

3. **Mercedes EQB 350 4MATIC SUV:** (While it brings Mercedes-Benz luxury and solid build quality, it falls short on range (around 250 miles), charging speed (100 kW max), and interior space compared to the other two. Itâ€™s also the smallest and least powerful of the bunch)


## Speculated Updates and Rankings after Updates (Subject to change)

1. **Mercedes EQB 350 4MATIC SUV:** Renamed to the GLB Electric, it is expected to have an new MBUX superscreen and AI powered user assistant, MB.OS (Mercedes-Benz Operating System), a new range of 305 miles, a frunk, much faster 320 volt charging, and retractable door handles. These changes will bring the Mercedes all the way to the top of the list.

2. **Kia EV9:** is expected to have slight upgrades to range, steering response, and acceleration, but nothing major.

3. **Hyundai IONIQ 9:** No speculated updates for now
